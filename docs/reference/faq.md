## üö® Troubleshooting

### CloudViz returns "No resources found"
Check:
1. **Credentials**: Verify cloud provider authentication
2. **Permissions**: Ensure sufficient read permissions
3. **Regions**: Check if scanning correct regions
4. **Filters**: Remove restrictive resource filters

### API calls are timing out
Solutions:
1. **Increase timeout**: Set `CLOUDVIZ_TIMEOUT=600`
2. **Reduce scope**: Scan fewer resource groups/regions
3. **Use filters**: Limit to specific resource types
4. **Check network**: Verify connectivity to cloud APIs

### Diagrams are not generating
Troubleshoot:
1. **Check resources**: Ensure resources were discovered
2. **Verify format**: Use supported diagram formats
3. **Reduce complexity**: Filter resources for simpler diagrams
4. **Check logs**: Review CloudViz logs for errors

### High memory usage
Optimize:
1. **Reduce batch size**: Set `CLOUDVIZ_BATCH_SIZE=50`
2. **Clear cache**: POST to `/api/v1/admin/cache/clear`
3. **Limit workers**: Set `CLOUDVIZ_WORKERS=2`
4. **Filter resources**: Use resource type filters

## üîß Configuration
