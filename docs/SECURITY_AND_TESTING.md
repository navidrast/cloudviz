# CloudViz Security and Testing Setup

This document describes the security scanning and testing setup for CloudViz.

## Security Scanning (Manual Review Only)

CloudViz implements comprehensive security scanning with **manual review only** - no automatic fixes or commits are made.

### Enabled Security Tools

1. **CodeQL** - Advanced semantic analysis for Python
2. **Bandit** - Python security linter
3. **Safety** - Python dependency vulnerability scanner
4. **Semgrep** - Security pattern detection
5. **Trivy** - Container image vulnerability scanning

### Manual Review Process

- All security findings require manual review by maintainers
- No automatic PR commits or fixes are generated
- Security alerts are reviewed and prioritized by severity
- Fixes are implemented through standard PR process

### Configuration

- **CodeQL Config**: `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`
- **Security Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- **Security Policy**: `SECURITY.md`

## Pull Request Testing

### Automated Tests

1. **PR Validation**
   - Title and description requirements
   - Large file detection
   - Sensitive data scanning

2. **Code Quality**
   - Python linting (flake8)
   - Code formatting (black)
   - Import sorting (isort)
   - Type checking (mypy)

3. **Test Suite**
   - Unit tests (when available)
   - Integration tests (when available)
   - Import validation
   - Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows)
   - Multi-Python version (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)

4. **Security Checks**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Code security analysis
   - Report generation

5. **Build Validation**
   - Package building
   - Docker image building
   - Artifact generation
